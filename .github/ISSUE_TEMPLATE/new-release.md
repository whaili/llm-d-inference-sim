## Introduction

This document defines the process for releasing llm-d-inference-sim.

## Prerequisites

1. Permissions to push to the llm-d-inference-sim repository.

2. Set the required environment variables based on the expected release number:

   ```shell
   export MAJOR=0
   export MINOR=1
   export PATCH=0
   export REMOTE=origin
   ```

3. If creating a release candidate, set the release candidate number.

   ```shell
   export RC=1
   ```

## Release Process

1. If needed, clone the llm-d-inference-sim [repo].

   ```shell
   git clone -o ${REMOTE} git@github.com:llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim.git
   ```

2. If you already have the repo cloned, ensure it’s up-to-date and your local branch is clean.

3. Release Branch Handling:
   - For a Release Candidate:
     Create a new release branch from the `main` branch. The branch should be named `release-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}`, for example, `release-0.1`:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b release-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}
     ```

   - For a Major, Minor or Patch Release:
     A release branch should already exist. In this case, check out the existing branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b release-${MAJOR}.${MINOR} ${REMOTE}/release-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}
     ```

4. Update release-specific content, generate release artifacts, and stage the changes.

5. Sign, commit, and push the changes to the `llm-d-inference-sim` repo.

   For a release candidate:

    ```shell
    git commit -s -m "Updates artifacts for v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}-rc.${RC} release"
    ```

   For a major, minor or patch release:

    ```shell
    git commit -s -m "Updates artifacts for v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH} release"
    ```

6. Push your release branch to the llm-d-inference-sim remote.

    ```shell
    git push ${REMOTE} release-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}
    ```

7. Tag the head of your release branch with the number.

   For a release candidate:

    ```shell
    git tag -s -a v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}-rc.${RC} -m 'llm-d-inference-sim v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}-rc.${RC} Release Candidate'
    ```

   For a major, minor or patch release:

    ```shell
    git tag -s -a v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH} -m 'llm-d-inference-sim v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH} Release'
    ```

8. Push the tag to the llm-d-inference-sim repo.

   For a release candidate:

    ```shell
    git push ${REMOTE} v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}-rc.${RC}
    ```

   For a major, minor or patch release:

    ```shell
    git push ${REMOTE} v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}
    ```

9. Pushing the tag triggers CI action to build and publish the container image to the [ghcr registry].
10. Test the steps in the tagged quickstart guide after the PR merges. TODO add e2e tests! <!-- link to an e2e tests once we have such one -->
11. Create a [new release]:
    1. Choose the tag that you created for the release.
    2. Use the tag as the release title, i.e. `v0.1.0` refer to previous release for the content of the release body.
    3. Click "Generate release notes" and preview the release body.
    4. If this is a release candidate, select the "This is a pre-release" checkbox.
12. If you find any bugs in this process, create an [issue].

## Announce the Release

Use the following steps to announce the release.

1. Send an announcement email to `llm-d-contributors@googlegroups.com` with the subject:

   ```shell
   [ANNOUNCE] llm-d-inference-sim v${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH} is released
   ```

2. Add a link to the final release in this issue.

3. Close this issue.
