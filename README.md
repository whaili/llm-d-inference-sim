# vLLM Simulator
To help with development and testing we have developed a light weight vLLM simulator. It does not truly
run inference, but it does emulate responses to the HTTP REST endpoints of vLLM. 
Currently it supports partial OpenAI-compatible API:
- /v1/chat/completions 
- /v1/completions 
- /v1/models

In addition, it supports a subset of vLLM's Prometheus metrics. These metrics are exposed via the /metrics HTTP REST endpoint. Currently supported are the following metrics:
- vllm:lora_requests_info

The simulated inferense has no connection with the model and LoRA adapters specified in the command line parameters. The /v1/models endpoint returns simulated results based on those same command line parameters.

The simulator supports two modes of operation:
- `echo` mode: the response contains the same text that was received in the request. For `/v1/chat/completions` the last message for the role=`user` is used.
- `random` mode: the response is randomly chosen from a set of pre-defined sentences.

Timing of the response is defined by two parameters: `time-to-first-token` and `inter-token-latency`. 

For a request with `stream=true`: `time-to-first-token` defines the delay before the first token is returned, `inter-token-latency` defines the delay between subsequent tokens in the stream. 

For a requst with `stream=false`: the response is returned after delay of `<time-to-first-token> + (<inter-token-latency> * (<number_of_output_tokens> - 1))`

It can be run standalone or in a Pod for testing under packages such as Kind.

## Limitations
API responses contains a subset of the fields provided by the OpenAI API.

## Command line parameters
- `port`: the port the simulator listents on, mandatory
- `model`: the currently 'loaded' model, mandatory
- `lora`: a list of available LoRA adapters, separated by commas, optional, by default empty
- `mode`: the simulator mode, optional, by default `random`
 - `echo`: returns the same text that was sent in the request
 - `random`: returns a sentence chosen at random from a set of pre-defined sentences
- `time-to-first-token`: the time to the first token (in milliseconds), optional, by default zero
- `inter-token-latency`: the time to 'generate' each additional token (in milliseconds), optional, by default zero
- `max-loras`: maximum number of LoRAs in a single batch, optional, default is one
- `max-cpu-loras`: maximum number of LoRAs to store in CPU memory, optional, must be >= than max_loras, default is max_loras
- `max-running-requests`: maximum number of inference requests that could be processed at the same time


## Working with docker image

### Building
To build a Docker image of the vLLM Simulator, run:
```bash
make build-llm-d-inference-sim-image
```

### Running
To run the vLLM Simulator image under Docker, run:
```bash
docker run --rm --publish 8000:8000 ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:0.0.1  --port 8000 --model "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct" --lora "tweet-summary-0,tweet-summary-1"
```
**Note:** The above command exposes the simulator on port 8000, and serves the Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

## Standalone testing

### Building
To build the vLLM simulator, run:
```bash
make build-llm-d-inference-sim
```

### Running
To run the router in a standalone test environment, run:
```bash
./bin/llm-d-inference-sim --model my_model --port 8000
```
